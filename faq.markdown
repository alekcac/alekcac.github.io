# [](#header-1)FAQ

### [](#header-3)1. Can I use it for mobile web pages?

At the moment, MetaPerson Creator uses Unity WebGL, which unfortunately does not support mobile platforms. This means that you won't be able to integrate the creator into mobile web pages.

However, we are actively working on a version of MetaPerson Creator that is based on native WebGL. This version will be compatible with mobile platforms and will enable you to integrate the creator into any web pages. We're working hard to release this version as soon as possible, so please stay tuned for updates.

### [](#header-3)2. What other limitations do you have for intergation?

When integrating MetaPerson Creator into your website using an iframe, it's important to consider the size and aspect ratio of the iframe.

If the iframe is too small, there is a risk of UI controls overlapping or becoming difficult to use. To avoid this, we recommend using a landscape-oriented iframe with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or 16:9. This will give users enough space to interact with the creator without any issues.

It's also important to note that the specific size and aspect ratio of the iframe will depend on the layout and design of your website. So be sure to test the integration thoroughly to ensure that it works well with your website and provides a seamless user experience.
