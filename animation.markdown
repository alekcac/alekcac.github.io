## [](#header-2)Avatar animations

Remote Face can enrich your video conferencing experience by making your avatar movements more natural. This goal can be achieved by using face capture and/or lip sync. Face capture uses your webcamera to synchornize your avatar's head position with yours. Lip sync captures sound of you microphone to animate avatar's lips. Your computer may have number of video/audio recording devices, so you need to make sure that the correct ones will be used for capturing. Let's take a look at how to do it on different platforms:
