Sometimes uninstallation cannot be performed due to running programs that use the Remote Face. Close the programs listed in a prompt window and the uninstallation process will automatically resume.

The easiest way is to run this command in the Terminal:

sh /Applications/RemoteFace/uninstall.sh  

If you already removed this folder, you can try to install the Remote Face one more time and then uninstall it. It uses some special commands to unregister a virtual camera in your system.
