### [](#header-3)5. Why does my avatar move his lips when other people speak?

Remote Face uses Lip Sync technology for lips animation: it consumes the microphone input of your computer to synchronize the avatar's mouth with your speech. If you use audio speakers in a conference, the microphone picks up the voices of other meeting participants even if you are silent at the moment. There are two ways to avoid the problem mentioned above: 1. Use headphones so that the microphone doesn’t pick up the other people's voices 2. Temporary disable the lip sync by clicking on the microphone icon in settings menu.

### [](#header-3)6. Do I have to have a webcam to use Remote Face?

No, you only need a webcam if you want to synchronize the pose of your avatar with your current pose (i.e. head tracking)

### [](#header-3)7. Head tracking is not stable

Remote Face uses a camera connected to your computer to track the position of your head and sync with the position of your avatar. It is crucial to have a camera located right in front of you. The lighting is also very important: make sure that you do not have bright lights (for example window) behind you if you want head tracking to be more stable.
