# [](#header-1)Working with Remote Face
It pays off to create a good avatar for video conferencing. When starting the Remote Face for the first time, you will see a short video that explains how to generate an avatar. You may find a detailed description of the avatar generation process in the corresponding sections:

[Windows](generating_avatar_windows){: .btn .btn-purple }
[Mac OS](generating_avatar_mac){: .btn .btn-blue }

At the same time recommendations for your selfie are the same for all platforms:

*   The face should be easily recognizable in the photo. The photo should not be blurry.
*   There should be uniform good lighting, without dark shadows or too bright glare.
*   Keep a neutral facial expression or slight.
*   It's best to look straight into the camera without turning your neck or eyes.
*   We advise removing the glasses but this is not completely necessary.
