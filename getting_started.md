You will need an account on Avatar SDK website to export MetaPerson avatars. If you don't have an account yet, you can create it [here](https://accounts.avatarsdk.com/). After that you can take a [free trial](https://avatarsdk.com/pricing-cloud/) of the Pro plan. It gives you acces to all of the needed features.

To run the demo scene you will need a developer credentials that can be created/found at your [developer page](https://accounts.avatarsdk.com/developer/). Developer credentials are a pair of values (Client ID and Client Secret). Go to the Edit->Project Settings->Plugins->Avatar SDK Metaperson 2 section in UE Editor and set these parameters in corresponding fields:
