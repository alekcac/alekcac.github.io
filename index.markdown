# [](#header-1)What is Remote Face

Remote Face is a virtual camera that can be used with desktop video conferencing apps, replacing the webcam image with your custom, recognizable 3D avatar.

We want to help our users to maximize the efficiency of remote work  by eliminating the well-known problem known as Zoom Burnout. Remote Face allows you to :

*   maintain eye contact
*   always look good
*   choose one of the awesome backgrounds (or add your own)

Remote Face generates your 3D avatar from a single selfie without sending any images outside your computer.
